description: Understanding the neural basis of human movement in naturalistic scenarios
  is critical for expanding neuroscience research beyond constrained laboratory paradigms.
  The neural correlates of unstructured, spontaneous movements in completely naturalistic
  settings have rarely been studied, due in large part to a lack of available data.
  Here, we present our Annotated Joints in Long-term Electrocorticography for 12 human
  participants (AJILE12) dataset, the largest human neurobehavioral dataset that is
  publicly available; the dataset was recorded opportunistically during passive clinical
  epilepsy monitoring. AJILE12 includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings
  and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic
  movements, along with relevant metadata, including thousands of wrist movement events
  and annotated behavioral states. Neural recordings are available at 500 Hz from
  at least 64 electrodes per participant, for a total of 1280 hours. Pose trajectories
  at 9 upper-body keypoints, including wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints, were sampled
  at 30 frames per second and estimated from 118 million video frames. In adherence
  with the FAIR data principles, we have shared AJILE12 on The Dandi Archive in the
  Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard and developed a browser-based dashboard
  to facilitate data exploration and reuse.
