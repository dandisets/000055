description: Motor behaviors are central to many functions and dysfunctions of the
  brain, and understanding their neural basis has consequently been a major focus
  in neuroscience. However, most studies of motor behaviors have been restricted to
  artificial, repetitive paradigms, far removed from natural movements performed “in
  the wild.” Here, we leveraged recent advances in machine learning and computer vision
  to analyze intracranial recordings from 12 human subjects during thousands of spontaneous,
  unstructured arm reach movements, observed over several days for each subject. These
  naturalistic movements elicited cortical spectral power patterns consistent with
  findings from controlled paradigms, but with considerable neural variability across
  subjects and events. We modeled inter-event variability using ten behavioral and
  environmental features; the most important features explaining this variability
  were reach angle and day of recording. Our work is among the first studies connecting
  behavioral and neural variability across cortex in humans during unstructured movements
  and contributes to our understanding of long-term naturalistic behavior.
